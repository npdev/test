# Test task "Ryd"
# Context
Issues are a typical problem at ryd. Our support team wants to become more
efficient in resolving issues. They decided to build a software that can automate their
processes â€” the software that you're going to develop.
# Product Requirements
- Ryd users can report an issue.
- New issues should be automatically assigned to a free support agent.
- Support agents can only handle one issue at a time.
- Support agents resolve issues: once done the issue is marked as resolved
and the support agent becomes available to take a new issue.
- The system should be able to assign unassigned issues automatically when a
support agent becomes available.
